SHORT: GUIF v1.3 is a graphical front end to AmiTCP's finger command.

It needs AmiTCP to be installed, and the finger command to be in the
Amitcp:bin directory, it also requires AskEnv, and RexxReqTools both of which
are available on Aminet, full details on installation and usage can be found
in the included GUIF.guide.

This is my first release and as such I know it's not perfect so if any Arexx
gurus out there care to give an opinion I'd be very happy to hear from you.
